A little while back, I added a [Books](/books/) page to my website. However, it just contained an ugly widget of what I was currently reading provided by Goodreads. I finally got around to adding more content to this page. The currently reading data is still dynamically provided by Goodreads, but now its look and feel is more consistent with the rest of the site.

I also added several book recommendations. I opened up comments so you can add your own recommendations too.

Hope this helps and happy reading!
