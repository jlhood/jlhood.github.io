[Christian McCarrick](https://twitter.com/cmccarrick) reached out to me a few months ago after finding my post, [How to Set the Technical Direction for Your Team](/how-to-set-team-technical-direction/). He asked if I would do an interview for his SimpleLeadership podcast to discuss that post further, as well as other technical leadership topics. The interview was a lot of fun and we had a good discussion. The podcast is free and available via [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/setting-technical-direction-for-your-team-james-hood/id1260241682?i=1000390267757&mt=2), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/listen#/ps/Ivb3nmaqljrzjir3teixjahsxba) or stream it directly from the [SimpleLeadership blog](http://simpleleadership.io/setting-the-technical-direction-for-your-team-with-james-hood/).

Hope this helps!
