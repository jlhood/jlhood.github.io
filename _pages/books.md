## Recommended Reading

This is a list of books I recommend reading. If this list seems overwhelming, try the marathon strategy I describe in [Tips for New Software Developers](/tips-for-new-software-developers/). Establish a routine of reading for 20-30 minutes a day. What works best for me is to have a set time each day that I read, but there are other strategies as well. If 20-30 minutes seems too intimidating, make [Mini Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Habits-Smaller-Bigger-Results/dp/1494882272) the first book you read.

### Personal/Career Development

I'm putting personal development books first, because developers tend to prioritize them last. However, I've found that improving yourself as a person makes you a better developer, not to mention more satisfied with your job and life in general.

1. [Crucial Confrontations](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Confrontations-Resolving-Promises-Expectations/dp/0071446524) - This book changed the way I think about and handle confrontation. It's helped me immensely in my career and personal life.
1. [Finding Flow](https://www.amazon.com/Finding-Flow-Psychology-Engagement-Masterminds/dp/0465024114) - Concise, excellent read. The best book I've found explaining "how to feel consistently happy/satisfied in life."
1. [The Power of Vulnerability](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Vulnerability-Teachings-Authenticity-Connection/dp/B00D1Z9RFU) - Great counterargument to the "gladiator culture" of the stereotypical male-dominated technology workplace. You don't have to be an asshole to be a successful developer. ðŸ˜Š
1. [Self Compassion](https://www.amazon.com/Self-Compassion-Proven-Power-Being-Yourself/dp/0061733520) - Are you sensing a theme here? Yes, the software industry is filled with a bunch of Type A, overachievers who set high expectations on themselves and struggle with Imposter Syndrome. However, the pressure people put on themselves as a result can become counterproductive and lead to burnout. If this sounds like you, read this book.

### Productivity

1. [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) - I read this after writing my article on [Productivity Tips](/productivity-tips/), and this book does a great job of providing the psychological research to back up why the methods I use work so well. It also gave me ideas on how to take my productivity to the next level. It includes a lot of good food for thought on limiting social media use and measuring the value of that time spent vs your long term goals.
1. [Mini Habits](https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Habits-Smaller-Bigger-Results/dp/1494882272) - While Deep Work advocates for extremely long periods of focus, many struggle with the willpower to do this. Mini Habits provides a great strategy for short-circuiting the intimidation and fear of failure that can paralyze you from taking steps toward your life goals. It's a quick read and the author takes an entertaining, conversational tone.

### Software Development

1. [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X) - Essential read for any software developer.
1. [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670) - Excellent book breaking down many nuances in day-to-day code construction.
1. [The Mythical Man-Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959) - Oldie, but a goodie. Another essential foundational book for any developer or manager of developers.
1. [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) - Great book emphasizing coding best-practices.
1. [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) - How to be an effective software engineer in industry.

### Java

1. [Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-2nd-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683) - Must read for any Java developer, however its information is only current to Java 1.5, so doesn't include new Java features.
1. [Java 8 in Action](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Action-Lambdas-functional-style-programming/dp/1617291994) - Covers new features in Java 8.
1. [Java Concurrency in Practice](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601) - Great book for getting a deep understanding of just how hard concurrent programming is. I think the best reason to read this book is as a means of steering you away from quickly jumping to writing your own concurrent, shared-memory (buggy) solutions to problems. Use a framework! ðŸ˜Š

### Architecture/Design

1. [Design Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612) - Foundational GOF book. Must-read for any software developer.
1. [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) - I'm a big fan of DDD, and this is the original book on the topic.

### Other

1. [The Amazon Way](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Way-Leadership-Principles-Disruptive/dp/1499296770) - Fast read expanding on Amazon's leadership principles from a former Amazonian. Lots of fun stories from Amazon's early days.
1. [The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000) - I'm a huge fan of checklists as a low-cost way to ensure consistent behavior when required. This book covers why they are so helpful and what elements go into an effective checklist. The author is a surgeon who shares several fascinating (and sometimes unsettling) anecdotes from the medical world, showing how checklists can effectively minimize human error.
